        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p>
          I was first drawn to web development in 2010. I had just started my own e-commerce business and was in need of a new website to sell my products. There wasn't enough capital to hire a web designer, so I decided to do it myself. That is where my education began.        </p>
        <p>
          I focused my learning on items that aligned with the needs of my business. I quickly started to practice my new HTML and CSS skills. I built and edited the many themes for my e-commerce shop. By building my own store, I fell in love with designing and developing for the web.        </p>
        <p>
          Even after I built my store, I continued to study and learn. I quit selling items online and began freelancing for various clients. With each project my skills and knowledge grow. Web development is now my craft and I am alway looking for ways to improve.        </p>
